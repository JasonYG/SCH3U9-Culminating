  text("In diamond, all carbon atoms are covalently bonded to neighbouring carbons, forming a \ncovalent network with extremely strong intermolecular forces. This property of diamond \ncan be taken advantage of to create a stable environment for qubits to function. When a \ncarbon atom in the lattice is replaced with a nitrogen atom and another carbon atom is \nremoved, a nitrogen-vacancy pair (N-V) is created, where an extra electron is trapped by \nan otherwise strong lattice (Derbyshire, 2014). This trapped electron can be used as part \nof a quantum chip.", 50, 170);
