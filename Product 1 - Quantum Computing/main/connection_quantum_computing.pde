The spin states of electrons, \nfor example, must be well understood before the concept of superposition can be \nestablished. The modern quantum model of an atom is similar to the structure of the \nqubit, and thus without knowing about the quantum mechanical model of the atom, it is \nimpossible to comprehend quantum computing to its fullest.", 50, 350);
